Data Preprocessing
- Handle Missing Values
=> in your missng data either we put mean of that column or drop that particular row or fill zero

- Feature Scaling
=> Normalization or Standardisation - using these 2 techniques we converge our large values to small values, generally scale b/w 0-1

- Label Encoding => One hot encoding
=> we convert our text data like gender or city into binary form

- Train Test Split
=> to prevent from overfitting
